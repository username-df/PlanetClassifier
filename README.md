## Project introduction

Built a basic convolutional neural network to pratice PyTorch and image classification. The purpose of the model is to classify user-given images of planets.

## Training

The model was trained on a custom dataset of around 800 images, which were obtained from publicly available images found on Google Images.

## Results

The model works well when the inputted images are clear and the planets are easy to see.

But it can easily make misclassifications if there is noise in the images.
